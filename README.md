# DataMiningProject
# In this project we will be conducting comparisons between 3 different types or versions of classification algorithms. The goal is to develop our own working rudimentary versions of 1. Naive Bayes algorithm, 2. Bayesian networks, and C4.5 algorithm and get them as close to the originals output as possible. We will use skit learn package in python as well as Javas WEKA package to do these comparisons. We will be using Data Mining Concepts and Techniques Third Edition by Jiawei Han University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign Micheline Kamber Jian Pei Simon Fraser University for our main reference for information regarding our algorithms.
